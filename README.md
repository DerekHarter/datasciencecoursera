# Welcome Evaluators

Welcome to my example github public repository.  I have created the
repository using a BSD license, and selecting a standard .gitignore
for Python based projects.  This commit will add the description
to my readme file to test basic markup and editing of .md files
and committing and pushing to remote git repository.
